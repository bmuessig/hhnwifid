# hhnwifid
This utility is designed to keep you logged into the HHN WiFi by sending authentification keep-alive messages to the captive portal periodically.
No actions are performed if no authentification is needed or if the captive portal is not the correct one.

## Disclaimer
Only use this application if you accept the terms of service of the guest internet provided on site, otherwise DO NOT run it.
This utility is only designed to simplify the task of staying logged in and does not intend to violate the reason the portal exists.

## Usage
Simply run the application in the background and it will automatically keep you logged-in if you are connected to the guest WiFi.

## Compatibility
The application has been tested to work on Windows, macOS and iOS (via iSH). It should also work on Android (with Terminal Emulator) and Linux.
